	Abstract = {It often happens that a signal processing application will involve a matrix operator that is invariant under specific preunitary and postunitary matrix multiplications. This invariance feature may be exploited to establish algebraic invariance properties possessed by the singular vectors associated with that matrice's SVD representation. This characterization can be of considerable theoretical as well as computational value. To illustrate the utility of this approach, the new class of bisymmetric matrices will be examined in detail. Interest in bisymmetric matrices arises from their frequent appearance in signal processing applications. For instance, it is shown that the forward-backward data matrix arising in linear prediction is bisymmetric. The more general class of exponential bisymmetric matrices, which includes among its members the discrete Fourier transform, is also briefly examined.},

This object is achieved by utilizing a set of properties which the signal is known or is hypothesized as possessing. The measured signal is modified to the smallest degree necessary to sequentially possess each of the individual properties. Conditions for the algorithm's convergence are established in which the primary requirement is that a composite property mapping be closed. This is a relatively unrestricted condition in comparison to that required of most existing signal-enhancement algorithms},

	Abstract = {Using geometrical, algebraic, and statistical arguments, it is clarified why and when the singular value decomposition is successful in so-called subspace methods. First the concepts of long and short spaces are introduced, and a fundamental asymmetry in the consistency properties of the estimates is discussed. The model, which is associated with the short space, can be estimated consistently, but the estimates of the original data, which follow from the long space, are always inconsistent. An expression is found for the asymptotic bias in terms of canonical angles, which can be estimated from the data. This allows all equivalent reconstructions of the original signals to be described as a matrix ball, the center of which is the minimum variance estimate. Remarkably, the canonical angles also appear in the optimal weighting that is used in weighted subspace fitting approaches. The results are illustrated with a numerical simulation. A number of examples are discussed},

The methods considered are namely Kumaresan-Tufts, matrix pencil and Kung's direct data approximation. Through first-order perturbation analysis, we derive closed-form expressions of the variance of the complex mode, frequency and damping factor estimates. These expressions are used to compare the different methods and to determine the optimal prediction order for matrix pencil and direct data approximation methods. Application to the undamped case shows the coherence of the results with those already stated in the literature. It is also found that the variances converge linearly towards the Cramer-Rao bound. Finally, the theoretical results are verified using Monte Carlo simulations.},

	Abstract = {Head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) are used to achieve binaural sound spatialization. Originally, sound spatialization techniques that utilize HRTFs require an intended listener to undergo lengthy measurements with specialized equipment. Unfortunately, the alternative generic HRTFs increase localization errors especially in elevation. Another option that we are pursuing is to customize HRTFs based on the physical measurements of a listener such that their performance is equivalent to measured HRTFs. However, an initial step of decomposing measured HRTFs in order to reveal the parameters of the required structural pinna model must be performed. A new approach for the decomposition of HRTFs is suggested and evaluated on simulated examples. Finally, the method is used to decompose actual HRTFs and the results are evaluated.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new state-space method for spectral estimation based on a companion matrix technique in order to estimate frequency, damping factor, amplitude and phase of exponential sinusoids. The new method, called CSE (companion matrix based spectral estimation), is compared against a previously proposed method called HTLS which is based on the use of total least squares. The latter lies among the most promising methods in the field of spectroscopy where accuracy of parameter estimation is of utmost importance. Experiments performed on a simulated NMR signal prove CSE to be more robust in terms of failure rate, especially for low signal to noise ratio},

	Abstract = {Recently, a theory of Hankel operators associated with two-dimensional (2D) linear time-invariant systems has been developed. It is applicable to the class of noncausal systems with rational transfer functions. An algorithm for model order estimation and parameter identification has been developed based upon the singular value decomposition of a generalized Hankel Matrix. Applications are found in system identification and autoregressive moving average (ARMA) spectrum estimation. The characterization of the 2D Hankel operator constructed from sinusoidal data is discussed. In this case, the rank behavior is shown to be markedly different from that which holds for rational data. This fact, different from the case in 1D, suggests a method to separate sinusoids in 2D from colored noise obeying a rational difference equation.},

In this note we extend these techniques to estimate the parameters of exponentially damped sinusoidal signals in noise. The estimation procedure presented here makes use of "backward prediction" in addition to SVD. First, the method is applied to data consisting of one and two exponentially damped sinusoids. The choice of one and two signal components facilitates the comparison of estimation error in pole damping factors and pole frequencies to the appropriate Cramer-Rao (CR) bounds and to traditional methods of linear prediction. Second, our method is applied to an example due to Steiglitz [8] in which the data consists of noisy values of the impulse response samples (composed of many exponentially damped sinusoids) of a linear system having both poles and zeros. The poles of the system are accurately determined by our method and the zeros are obtained subsequently, using Shanks' method.},

The algorithms use three signal processing engines, namely, Prony's method, matrix pencil method and Hankel total least squares (HTLS) method. Results from these engines are processed using a custom developed set of rules for handling the complexities of modal analysis from real-time PMU measurements. The results are illustrated on several actual PMU recordings from power systems in North America.

	Abstract = {In different practical situations it is desired to estimate the number of signal sources and their positions in space or in frequency domain. The first problem is known as the detection or the order estimation and the second one as the resolution. For the resolution problem techniques such as nonlinear least squares (NLSM), high-order Yule-Walker method (HOYW), multiple signal classification (MUSIC), Pisarenko harmonic retrieval method, min-norm method, estimation of signal parameters by rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT), were proposed (Marple, 1987 and Stoica and Moses, 1997). All these high-resolution methods are based on the analysis of the signal covariance matrix. But the covariance matrix is not the only choice to represent the signal spectrum. In different applications (weather radars, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) signal processing, ultrasound imaging in medicine, atmospheric turbulence measurements) the signal spectrum can be modeled through its algebraic moments. Recently a number of efficient nonparametric methods have been proposed to estimate the algebraic spectral moments (Monakov, 1999). The presented paper is an attempt to solve the direction of arrival (DOA) problem via estimation of the algebraic spectral moments. A method proposed in the article is comparable in its accuracy with the MUSIC method. At the same time its computational burden is much lower. The method permits to estimate the signal power of sources easily to complete the full spectral line analysis. Additionally the method shows good robustness in situations when signal sources have noticeable spatial extend},

@inproceedings{Osorio.etal2008,
	Abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is an effective diagnostic technique for monitoring biochemical changes in an organism. The lineshape of MRS signals can deviate from the theoretical Lorentzian or exponential lineshape due to inhomogeneities of magnetic field applied to the patient and to patientpsilas tissue heterogeneity. We call this deviation a distortion. Using an improved damping function, we estimate the lineshape with an iterative method that finds optimal parameters. In our simulations we investigate whether estimation of the unknown distorted damping function can improve the overall result. Our method improves on that in, by including iterations, consisting of applying Hankel Singular Value decomposition (HSVD) and Nonlinear Least Squares (NLLS) to calculate the frequencies, amplitudes and phases that are used to estimate a common damping function finally applied to a metabolite database; the method is applied iteratively until the parameterspsila convergence is reached. For our simulations we used a signal with 11 undamped Lorentzian components inspired by the benchmark signal of <sup>31</sup>P provided in. Results show that identifying the right model complexity using a convenient number of sinusoids improves significantly the iterative method. Comparison of residuals for the first and last iterations show a clear improvement. We consider the bias-variance trade-off because increasing the number of sinusoids decreases the bias but increases the variance and vice versa, so we look for an optimal order that leads to the best possible results. Although perfect estimation of the lineshape distortion is difficult, simulations are important to find a good approximation. Since parameters estimated in the first iteration are used for the next ones, a bad initial estimate will affect the final result. Iterations provided the expected successive improvements, due to the enhancement of estimations.},

@article{Ramos2006,
	Abstract = {Most lumped rainfall-runoff models separate the interflow and groundwater components from the measured runoff hydrograph in an attempt to model these as hydrologic reservoir units. Similarly, rainfall losses due to infiltration as well as other abstractions are separated from the measured rainfall hyetograph, which are then used as inputs to the various hydrologic reservoir units. This data pre-processing is necessary in order to use the linear unit hydrograph theory, as well as for maintaining a hydrologic budget between the surface and subsurface flow processes. Since infiltration determines the shape of the runoff hydrograph, it must be estimated as accurately as possible. When measured infiltration data is available, Horton's exponential infiltration model is preferable due to its simplicity. However, estimating the parameters from Horton's model constitutes a nonlinear least squares fitting problem. Hence, an iterative procedure that requires initialization is subject to convergence. In a similar context, the separation of direct runoff, interflow, and baseflow from the total hydrograph is typically done in an ad hoc manner. However, many practitioners use exponential models in a rather ``layer peeling'' fashion to perform this separation. In essence, this also constitutes an exponential data fitting problem. Likewise, certain variogram functions can be fitted using exponential data fitting techniques. In this paper we show that fitting a Hortonian model to experimental data, as well as performing hydrograph separation, and total hydrograph and variogram fitting can all be formulated as a system identification problem using Hankel-based realization algorithms. The main advantage is that the parameters can be estimated in a noniterative fashion, using robust numerical linear algebra techniques. As such, the system identification algorithms overcome the problem of convergence inherent in iterative techniques. In addition, the algorithms are robust to noise in the data since they optimally separate the signal and noise subspaces from the observed noisy data. The algorithms are tested with real data from field experiments performed in Surinam, as well as with real hydrograph data from a watershed in Louisiana. The system identification techniques presented herein can also be used with any other type of exponential data such as exponential decays from nuclear experiments, tracer studies, and compartmental analysis studies.},

The locations of estimated spectral peaks can be greatly affected by a small amount of noise because of the appearance of outliers. LP estimation of frequencies can be greatly improved at low SNR by singular value decomposition (SVD) of the LP data matrix.

We consider the difficult case in which samples of data are taken over a short interval of time or space and the frequencies of the sinusoidal signal and sinusoidal interference are more closely spaced than the reciprocal of the extent of the aperture. The method can be applied to cases of nonsinusoidal and/or random signals and interference. The most important assumption is that when the samples of the interference are arranged in matrix form the matrix is approximately of low rank in the sense that, with high probability, the interference-only matrix can be well approximated by a matrix of low rank.},

This approach provides insights for design and tractable formulas even for the case of multicomponent signals and Hankel or Toeplitz data matrices.

Both known and new SVD-based identification methods are classified in a subspace-oriented scheme. The SVD of a matrix constructed from the observed signal data provides the key step in a robust discrimination between desired signals and disturbing signals in terms of signal and noise subspaces. The methods that are presented are distinguished by the way in which the subspaces are determined and how the signal or system model parameters are extracted from these subspaces. Typical examples, such as the direction-of-arrival problem and system identification from input/output measurements, are elaborated upon, and some extensions to time-varying systems are given},

	Abstract = {The total least squares (TLS) method is a generalization of the least squares (LS) method for solving overdetermined sets of linear equations Ax&ap;b. The TLS method minimizes ||[E|-r]||<sub>F</sub>, where r=b-(A+E)x, so that (b-r)&isin;Range (A+E), given A&isin;C<sup>m&times;n</sup>, with m&ges;n and b&isin;C<sup>m&times;1</sup>. The most common TLS algorithm is based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) of [A/b]. However, the SVD-based methods may not be appropriate when the matrix A has a special structure since they do not preserve the structure. Previously, a new problem formulation known as structured total least norm (STLN), and the algorithm for computing the STLN solution, have been developed. The STLN method preserves the special structure of A or [A/b] and can minimize the error in the discrete L<sub>p</sub> norm, where p=1, 2 or &infin;. In this paper, the STLN problem formulation is generalized for computing the solution of STLN problems with multiple right-hand sides AX&ap;B. It is shown that these problems can be converted to ordinary STLN problems with one right-hand side. In addition, the method is shown to converge to the optimal solution in certain model reduction problems. Furthermore, the application of the STLN method to various parameter estimation problems is studied in which the computed correction matrix applied to A or [A/B] keeps the same Toeplitz structure as the data matrix A of [A/B], respectively. In particular, the L<sub>2</sub> norm STLN method is compared with the LS and TLS methods in deconvolution, transfer function modeling, and linear prediction problems},

Based on prior knowledge and decimation, a novel subspace-based parameter estimation method HTLSDStackPK is presented in this paper. The simulated results and relevant analysis show that HTLSDStackPK also has much better performance of parameter estimation than HTLS at high noise levels. Compared with HTLS-PK, HTLSDStackPK does not lead to better estimation, but the different is not high, and computational complexity of HTLSDStackPK is much lower than that of HTLS-PK},
