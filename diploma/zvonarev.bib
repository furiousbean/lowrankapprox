	and the second one as the resolution. For the resolution problem
	techniques such as nonlinear least squares (NLSM), high-order Yule-Walker
	method (HOYW), multiple signal classification (MUSIC), Pisarenko
	harmonic retrieval method, min-norm method, estimation of signal
	parameters by rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT), were proposed
	(Marple, 1987 and Stoica and Moses, 1997). All these high-resolution
	methods are based on the analysis of the signal covariance matrix.
	But the covariance matrix is not the only choice to represent the
	signal spectrum. In different applications (weather radars, synthetic
	aperture radar (SAR) signal processing, ultrasound imaging in medicine,
	atmospheric turbulence measurements) the signal spectrum can be modeled
	through its algebraic moments. Recently a number of efficient nonparametric
	methods have been proposed to estimate the algebraic spectral moments
	(Monakov, 1999). The presented paper is an attempt to solve the direction
	of arrival (DOA) problem via estimation of the algebraic spectral
	moments. A method proposed in the article is comparable in its accuracy
	with the MUSIC method. At the same time its computational burden
	is much lower. The method permits to estimate the signal power of
	sources easily to complete the full spectral line analysis. Additionally
	the method shows good robustness in situations when signal sources
	have noticeable spatial extend},

  abstract = {Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is an effective diagnostic technique
	for monitoring biochemical changes in an organism. The lineshape
	of MRS signals can deviate from the theoretical Lorentzian or exponential
	lineshape due to inhomogeneities of magnetic field applied to the
	patient and to patientpsilas tissue heterogeneity. We call this deviation
	a distortion. Using an improved damping function, we estimate the
	lineshape with an iterative method that finds optimal parameters.
	In our simulations we investigate whether estimation of the unknown
	distorted damping function can improve the overall result. Our method
	improves on that in, by including iterations, consisting of applying
	Hankel Singular Value decomposition (HSVD) and Nonlinear Least Squares
	(NLLS) to calculate the frequencies, amplitudes and phases that are
	used to estimate a common damping function finally applied to a metabolite
	database; the method is applied iteratively until the parameterspsila
	convergence is reached. For our simulations we used a signal with
	11 undamped Lorentzian components inspired by the benchmark signal
	of <sup>31</sup>P provided in. Results show that identifying the
	right model complexity using a convenient number of sinusoids improves
	significantly the iterative method. Comparison of residuals for the
	first and last iterations show a clear improvement. We consider the
	bias-variance trade-off because increasing the number of sinusoids
	decreases the bias but increases the variance and vice versa, so
	we look for an optimal order that leads to the best possible results.
	Although perfect estimation of the lineshape distortion is difficult,
	simulations are important to find a good approximation. Since parameters
	estimated in the first iteration are used for the next ones, a bad
	initial estimate will affect the final result. Iterations provided
	the expected successive improvements, due to the enhancement of estimations.},

  abstract = {Most lumped rainfall-runoff models separate the interflow and groundwater
	components from the measured runoff hydrograph in an attempt to model
	these as hydrologic reservoir units. Similarly, rainfall losses due
	to infiltration as well as other abstractions are separated from
	the measured rainfall hyetograph, which are then used as inputs to
	the various hydrologic reservoir units. This data pre-processing
	is necessary in order to use the linear unit hydrograph theory, as
	well as for maintaining a hydrologic budget between the surface and
	subsurface flow processes. Since infiltration determines the shape
	of the runoff hydrograph, it must be estimated as accurately as possible.
	When measured infiltration data is available, Horton’s exponential
	infiltration model is preferable due to its simplicity. However,
	estimating the parameters from Horton’s model constitutes a nonlinear
	least squares fitting problem. Hence, an iterative procedure that
	requires initialization is subject to convergence. In a similar context,
	the separation of direct runoff, interflow, and baseflow from the
	total hydrograph is typically done in an ad hoc manner. However,
	many practitioners use exponential models in a rather “layer peeling”
	fashion to perform this separation. In essence, this also constitutes
	an exponential data fitting problem. Likewise, certain variogram
	functions can be fitted using exponential data fitting techniques.
	In this paper we show that fitting a Hortonian model to experimental
	data, as well as performing hydrograph separation, and total hydrograph
	and variogram fitting can all be formulated as a system identification
	problem using Hankel-based realization algorithms. The main advantage
	is that the parameters can be estimated in a noniterative fashion,
	using robust numerical linear algebra techniques. As such, the system
	identification algorithms overcome the problem of convergence inherent
	in iterative techniques. In addition, the algorithms are robust to
	noise in the data since they optimally separate the signal and noise
	subspaces from the observed noisy data. The algorithms are tested
	with real data from field experiments performed in Surinam, as well
	as with real hydrograph data from a watershed in Louisiana. The system
	identification techniques presented herein can also be used with
	any other type of exponential data such as exponential decays from
	nuclear experiments, tracer studies, and compartmental analysis studies.},

	algorithm is based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) of [A/b].
	However, the SVD-based methods may not be appropriate when the matrix
	A has a special structure since they do not preserve the structure.
	Previously, a new problem formulation known as structured total least
	norm (STLN), and the algorithm for computing the STLN solution, have
	been developed. The STLN method preserves the special structure of
	A or [A/b] and can minimize the error in the discrete L<sub>p</sub>
	norm, where p=1, 2 or &infin;. In this paper, the STLN problem formulation
	is generalized for computing the solution of STLN problems with multiple
	right-hand sides AX&ap;B. It is shown that these problems can be
	converted to ordinary STLN problems with one right-hand side. In
	addition, the method is shown to converge to the optimal solution
	in certain model reduction problems. Furthermore, the application
	of the STLN method to various parameter estimation problems is studied
	in which the computed correction matrix applied to A or [A/B] keeps
	the same Toeplitz structure as the data matrix A of [A/B], respectively.
	In particular, the L<sub>2</sub> norm STLN method is compared with
